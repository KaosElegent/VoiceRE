# VoiceRE

Currently, the project is in the same state that it was during the 36-hour hackathon. Since we started 12 hours late, we weren't able to get it into a very presentable format so I'll be working on this in my free time to polish it up ever so slightly.

## Technologies Used:
- Next.js (with typescript)
- Flask
- Google API
- OpenAI
- Cloudinary
- MongoDB Atlas
- Flow Blockchain (researched and prototyped but not implemented)
